## Intro

In this workshop we will be focussed on learning more about Git - a version control system used to track changes to files during a project. Version control is important in larger projects that multiple developers are working on, because changes by one person may impact changes made by another person, and there needs to be a constient and simple way to resolve conflicts if two people work on the same thing. Git also allows you to look through the history of your work so you can undo any changes that may have broken your program. You will use Git in this project to track the changes you make to the mini console.

### Git vs Github/Bitbucket
You may have heard of names like [Github](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). These are platforms that host/store your source code for a project and use Git to enable version control. So Git, Github and Bitbucket are not names to be used synonymously. If you want to read more about the differences, have a read through [this](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Git-vs-GitHub-What-is-the-difference-between-them) article. 

For this project, the software is hosted on **Bitbucket**

### But what about Git GUI's?

There are many ways of interacting with Git. The most basic is through the command line, typing commands directly into the shell. However, there have been some Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's) developed to make using Git in your project simpler. A lot of Integrated Development Environment's (IDE's) like Visual Studio and Eclipse have functionality to import projects from Git or Bitbucket and interact with Git through their platform. You can also interact from the Github and Bitbucket webpages. 

For this project, you will be interacting with Git through the command line you experimented with yesterday. Those of you who have used Git before may be wondering why we aren't using the Bitbucket website, or other GUI's to interact with Git. While these are fine (and handy) ways of using Git, it is important to learn the basics through command line so you can develop a good understanding of what goes on in the background when you use these interfaces.
