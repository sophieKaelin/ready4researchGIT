# Getting Your Work Incorporated

At the moment, all your work is sitting on your forked repository. In incorporate your progress with the main repository, you will need to create a **Pull Request**. Before you do that, you will want to make sure your repository and changes are in a complete state that will not introduce bugs or uneccesary code into the main repository.

## Pull Requests

<!--TODO: Vague instructions, and then video with Matt. Cece and I will make a pull request with a conflict.-->

<!--Process used for open-source projects. If they want to continue to work on projects like this, they could find something on a site like https://www.firsttimersonly.com/ where they can clone a repo, branch, make changes, push the branch and then create a PR. The communities on the websites on that page are friendly and tag issues for beginners to help get them started on projects-->
