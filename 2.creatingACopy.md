# 2. Creating a Copy of the Project

<!--TODO: Something else to add here for what they are learning?-->

There are a lot of different ways we could contribute code to a repository. Different methods are more appropriate than others depending on the scale, number of collaborators and security needs of a project.  
You can *Download Source Code*, *Invite Collaborators* or *Fork*:

* **Download Sourcecode**: Downloading the source code will remove its relationship to the repository, and will just give you the files to play around with on your own device.
* **Inviting Collaborators**: When the owner of the repository invites collaborators to a project, collaborators changes get pushed straight to the main repository on the creators account. You could introduce [Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches#:~:text=In%20Git%2C%20branches%20are%20a,branch%20to%20encapsulate%20your%20changes.) so that collaborators can work on certain features without impacting the main branch as a way to avoid losing code.
<!--* **Cloning Repositories**: Cloning a repository creates a remote copy of all the source code in a repository on your device. You can clone repositories thatIt is no longer associated with the main repository, and is just a series of files. You would clone a repository if you want a copy of the repository without the version history.-->
* **Forking Repositories**: Forking is copying the repository from the authors account to your own Bitbucket/Github acount. That way, any changes you push only impact your own repository and not the main repository. You can fork any public repository that has enabled it and you are able to create a pull request to merge your work back to the main repository. The commit history is maintained.

<!--TODO: Maybe include a visual representation of this-->

The appropriateness of these methods depends on the project you are working on.

Because many teams are going to be working on the mini console, you will be creating a **Fork** of the project for your individual team to work on. When you have implemented something that works, you can submit a Pull Request to merge your changes with the main project repository (*more on that later*).


## 2.1 Fork the Repository
<!--TODO: Make sure it is the correct link to the repo-->

1. Nominate one group members account to host the forked repository. You will only need to fork it once, and then everyone in your group can work on the same copy.
2. Head to the location of the mini console on Bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/macquarieclassicmini/mqclassicmini/commits/](https://bitbucket.org/macquarieclassicmini/mqclassicmini/commits/).
3. Select the create button ("+" symbol) on the left most side of the screen and then select the option "Fork this repository" and then follow the instructions that appear. Once you've done this, you should see a copy of the repository attached to your own account.


Well done! You know have a copy of the classic mini console on your account. Next we will want to grant everyone in the team access to the repository.
