### What is Commiting?
When, for instance, you are playing a computer game and you make some positive progress, your instinct would be to save the game so that if you make a mistake later on, you can revert back to your previous saved checkpoint. Making a `commit` is a similar concept. Whenever you have made some positive progress with your source code, you will want to make a `commit` which will save/record a snapshot of your source code at that point in time on your local device. That way, if you make a mistake later on, you can revert back to that commit. Needless to say, you should only be making commits of code that works.

### Tracking Changes
On big projects you are going to have a very large number of commits.
<!--Status-->
<!--Log-->
<!--Only reflects last pull and remote commits-->

### Exploring History

<!--Look through cl and bitbucket -->
<!--git log --graph for a tree (not interesting until there are merge conflicts)-->
