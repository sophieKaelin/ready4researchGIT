<!--TODO: Talk about Merging and Stashing too-->
<!--re stashing : 3 scenarios: 
1. You pull, you have unsaved changes (stash)
2. You pull, you've committed (merge conflict)
3. You pull, you have no changes or your commits are unrelated-->

<!--TODO: talk about git diff to view changes-->
<!--TODO: Talk about removing changes-->
<!--TODO: Reseting repo to hard reset-->

## Commiting
<!--TODO: Get them to change something meaningful, not just their names-->

## Pushing

## Pulling

## Conflicts
<!-- Force a conflict-->
