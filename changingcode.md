# Changing Code in Git
<!--TODO: Talk about Merging and Stashing too-->
<!--re stashing : 3 scenarios: 
1. You pull, you have unsaved changes (stash)
2. You pull, you've committed (merge conflict)
3. You pull, you have no changes or your commits are unrelated-->

<!--TODO: talk about git diff to view changes-->
<!--TODO How to unstage changes-->

### Removing Changes
Depending on the situation, there are various ways you can remove changes or updates you've made. Here are some sample situations:

* You have only unstaged changes (saved locally, but not `added`)
* You have only staged changes (used the `git add` command)
* You have a combination of staged and unstaged changes
* You have some changes you want to keep, others you don't

## Commiting
<!--TODO: Get them to change something meaningful, not just their names-->

## Pushing

## Pulling
<!--TODO: talk about fetch vs pull. Fetch checks if there are changes to the repo, but doesn't apply anything. Pulling checks AND applies those changes straight away-->

## Conflicts
<!-- Force a conflict-->

<!--TODO: Maybe add a section on playing around with history?
